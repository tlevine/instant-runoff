write e-mails in groff.


Setup
=====
Install.

    pip2 install instant-runoff

Then add these macros to your muttrc.

.. literalinclude:: muttrc

Usage
=====

Press **g** in mutt to send a multi-part html/txt/groff message;
**ESC+g** can be used to preview a message's groff output.
**ESC+r** will replace the message with txt+groff and allow nor-
mal sending. This may be useful for encrypted groff-mails.

instant-runoff is set up to use the **ms** macro package,
and preprocess input with **tbl**.
